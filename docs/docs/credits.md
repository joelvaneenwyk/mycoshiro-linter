# Credits

Thanks to all of the different people who have contributed to this plugin!

A special thanks to [chrisgrieser](https://github.com/chrisgrieser) for doing all of the base work for and for suggesting that the paste logic should reside in the Linter!

A special thanks to [Michael Naumov](https://github.com/mnaoumov) for rewriting the Linter in such a way that it could warn
about invalid usages of option values, make sure that the proper properties were set in settings, and much much more!
