## Header Increment

Alias: `header-increment`

### Options

| Name | Description | List Items | Default Value |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| `Start Header Increment at Heading Level 2` | Makes heading level 2 the minimum heading level in a file for header increment and shifts all headings accordingly so they increment starting with a level 2 heading. | N/A | false |

### Examples

<details><summary>Heading levels are decremented as needed</summary>

Before:

`````` markdown
# H1
### H3
### H3
#### H4
###### H6

We skipped a 2nd level heading
``````

After:

`````` markdown
# H1
## H3
## H3
### H4
#### H6

We skipped a 2nd level heading
``````

</details>
<details><summary>Skipped headings in sections that would be decremented will result in those headings not having the same meaning</summary>

Before:

`````` markdown
# H1
### H3

We skip from 1 to 3

###### H6

We skip from 3 to 6 leaving out 4, 5, and 6. Thus headings level 4 and 5 will be treated like H3 above until another H2 or H1 is encountered

##### H5

We skipped 5 previously so it will be treated the same as the H3 above since it was the next lowest header that was to be decremented

## H2

This resets the decrement section so the H6 below is decremented to an H3

###### H6
``````

After:

`````` markdown
# H1
## H3

We skip from 1 to 3

### H6

We skip from 3 to 6 leaving out 4, 5, and 6. Thus headings level 4 and 5 will be treated like H3 above until another H2 or H1 is encountered

## H5

We skipped 5 previously so it will be treated the same as the H3 above since it was the next lowest header that was to be decremented

# H2

This resets the decrement section so the H6 below is decremented to an H3

## H6
``````

<details><summary>When `Start Header Increment at Heading Level 2 = true`, H1s become H2s and the other headers are incremented accordingly</summary>
