# Rules

## General Settings

### Default Escape Character

The default character to use to escape YAML values when a single quote and double quote are not present.

- Default: `"`
- `"`: Use a double quote to escape if no single or double quote is present
- `'`: Use a single quote to escape if no single or double quote is present

### Yaml aliases section style

The style of the YAML aliases section

- Default: `single-line`
- `multi-line`: ```aliases:\n  - Title```
- `single-line`: ```aliases: [Title]```
- `single string comma delimited`: ```aliases: Title, Other Title```
- `single string to single-line`: Aliases will be formatted as a string if there is 1 or fewer elements like so ```aliases: Title```. If there is more than 1 element, it will be formatted like a single-line array.
- `single string to multi-line`: Aliases will be formatted as a string if there is 1 or fewer elements like so ```aliases: Title```. If there is more than 1 element, it will be formatted like a multi-line array.

### Format Yaml Array

Alias: `format-yaml-array`

Allows for the formatting of regular yaml arrays as either multi-line or single-line and `tags` and `aliases` are allowed to have some Obsidian specific yaml formats. Note that single string to single-line goes from a single string entry to a single-line array if more than 1 entry is present. The same is true for single string to multi-line except it becomes a multi-line array.

Options:
- Format yaml aliases section: Turns on formatting for the yaml aliases section. You should not enable this option alongside the rule `YAML Title Alias` as they may not work well together or they may have different format styles selected causing unexpected results.
	- Default: `true`
- Format yaml tags section: Turns on formatting for the yaml tags section.
	- Default: `true`
- Default yaml array section style: The style of other yaml arrays that are not `tags`, `aliases` or  in `Force key values to be single-line arrays` and `Force key values to be multi-line arrays`
	- Default: `single-line`
	- `multi-line`: ```key:\n  - value```
	- `single-line`: ```key: [value]```
- Format yaml array sections: Turns on formatting for regular yaml arrays
	- Default: `true`
- Force key values to be single-line arrays: Forces the yaml array for the new line separated keys to be in single-line format (leave empty to disable this option)
	- Default: ``
- Force key values to be multi-line arrays: Forces the yaml array for the new line separated keys to be in multi-line format (leave empty to disable this option)
	- Default: ``

Example: Format tags as a single-line array delimited by spaces and aliases as a multi-line array and format the key `test` to be a single-line array

Before:

``````markdown
---
tags:
  - computer
  - research
aliases: Title 1, Title2
test: this is a value
---

# Notes:

Nesting yaml arrays may result in unexpected results.

Multi-line arrays will have empty values removed only leaving one if it is completely empty. The same is not true for single-line arrays as that is invalid yaml unless it comes as the last entry in the array.
``````

After:

``````markdown
---
tags: [computer, research]
aliases:
  - Title 1
  - Title2
test: [this is a value]
---

# Notes:

Nesting yaml arrays may result in unexpected results.

Multi-line arrays will have empty values removed only leaving one if it is completely empty. The same is not true for single-line arrays as that is invalid yaml unless it comes as the last entry in the array.
``````
Example: Format tags as a single string with space delimiters, ignore aliases, and format regular yaml arrays as single-line arrays

Before:

``````markdown
---
aliases: Typescript
types:
  - thought provoking
  - peer reviewed
tags: [computer, science, trajectory]
---
``````

After:

``````markdown
---
aliases: Typescript
types: [thought provoking, peer reviewed]

  - id: test123
    url: 'some_url'
    filename: file.md
    isPublic: true
---
``````

After:

### Header Increment

Alias: `header-increment`

Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time

Options:
- Start Header Increment at Heading Level 2: Makes heading level 2 the minimum heading level in a file for header increment and shifts all headings accordingly so they increment starting with a level 2 heading.
	- Default: `false`

Example: 

Before:

``````markdown
# H1
### H3
### H3
#### H4
###### H6

We skipped a 2nd level heading
``````

After:

``````markdown
# H1
## H3
## H3
### H4
#### H6

We skipped a 2nd level heading
``````
Example: Skipped headings in sections that would be decremented will result in those headings not having the same meaning

Before:

``````markdown
# H1
### H3

We skip from 1 to 3

###### H6

We skip from 3 to 6 leaving out 4, 5, and 6. Thus headings level 4 and 5 will be treated like H3 above until another H2 or H1 is encountered

##### H5

We skipped 5 previously so it will be treated the same as the H3 above since it was the next lowest header that was to be decremented

## H2

This resets the decrement section so the H6 below is decremented to an H3

###### H6
``````

After:

``````markdown
# H1
## H3

We skip from 1 to 3

### H6

We skip from 3 to 6 leaving out 4, 5, and 6. Thus headings level 4 and 5 will be treated like H3 above until another H2 or H1 is encountered

## H5

We skipped 5 previously so it will be treated the same as the H3 above since it was the next lowest header that was to be decremented

# H2

This resets the decrement section so the H6 below is decremented to an H3

## H6
``````
Example: When `Start Header Increment at Heading Level 2 = true`, H1s become H2s and the other headers are incremented accordingly

Before:

``````markdown
# H1 becomes H2
#### H4 becomes H3
###### H6
## H2
###### H6
# H1
## H2
``````

After:

``````markdown
## H1 becomes H2
### H4 becomes H3
#### H6
## H2
### H6
## H1
### H2
``````

``````

After:

``````markdown
## Other heading preceded by 2 spaces ##
_Note that if the spacing is enough for the header to be considered to be part of a codeblock it will not be affected by this rule._

once possessives and common contractions have been dealt with. If not, it will throw an error.

### Empty Line Around Math Blocks

Alias: `empty-line-around-math-blocks`

Ensures that there is an empty line around math blocks using `Number of Dollar Signs to Indicate a Math Block` to determine how many dollar signs indicates a math block for single-line math.



Example: Math blocks that start a document do not get an empty line before them.

Before:

``````markdown
$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}
$$
some more text
``````

After:

``````markdown
$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}
$$

some more text
``````
Example: Math blocks that are singe-line are updated based on the value of `Number of Dollar Signs to Indicate a Math Block` (in this case its value is 2)

Before:

``````markdown
$$\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}$$
some more text
``````

After:

``````markdown
$$\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}$$

some more text
``````
Example: Math blocks that end a document do not get an empty line after them.

Before:

``````markdown
Some text
$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}
$$
``````

After:

``````markdown
Some text

$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}
$$
``````
Example: Math blocks that are not at the start or the end of the document will have an empty line added before and after them

Before:

``````markdown
Some text
$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}

After:

``````markdown
Some text

$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y\end{bmatrix}
$$

``````
Example: Math blocks in callouts or blockquotes have the appropriately formatted blank lines added
